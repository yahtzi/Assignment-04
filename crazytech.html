            <h2>The Craziest Man in Tech</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned before, McAfee is most well known for creating the McAfee software, but that's the least interesting thing about him. Here's a list of things that have 
            happened more recently in his life.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In 2012 his Central American jungle compound was raided by police's gang suppression unit because they thought he was cooking up meth.</li>
                <li>Six months later he became an international fugitive after his neighbor was found dead and he was named as the lead suspect following a media storm.</li>
                <li>He was arrested by Interpol in Guatemala for illegally entering the country.</li>
                <li>With some quick thinking he managed to escape being deported back by faking a heart attack, giving his lawyer enough time to file an appeal so he can return to
                    the United States.</li>
                <li>A couple years later, McAfee ran for president</li>
            </ol>
        <p>This only scratches the surface of the absolute insanity that has been John McAfee's life.</p>
